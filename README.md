## Notes for my Assesors
Hi Geektastc Team, apologies for my difficulties in submitting the original attempt. I'm not used to sharing projects outside of git, so if I've missed any files out please feel free to let me know.
I've added some cursory tests to show that I am aware of the notion of TDD and testing as you go, but since there was a tight deadline and I am still working full time I couldnt right quite as many as I'd like.

Looking forward to your feedback and thanks for reviewing my project!
